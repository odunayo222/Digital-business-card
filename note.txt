-Declarative programming: simlying tell it what to be done
                          "just tell me what to do i'll figure it out myself" (react makes this possible)

-Imperative programming: "describe to me every step how to do something and ill do it"

-in react, you can only render a parent element
-jsx returns plan javascript object
-<></> are called fragments
-writing declaratively leads to fewer bugs and it is advised
